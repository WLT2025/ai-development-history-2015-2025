    <h2>Summary and Trends</h2>
    <p>Over the past decade, AI shifted from game-playing to generative tools powered by massive data and computing. Key drivers: scaling laws (bigger models perform better), transformers, and reinforcement learning. Companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic led, but open-source efforts broadened access. Impacts include efficiency gains in work and health, but challenges like bias, misinformation, and unemployment persist. Looking ahead, expect AGI discussions and stricter ethics.
